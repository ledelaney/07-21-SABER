Validity and
reliability evidence for the SECM was gathered in alignment with the Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing (AERA et al. 2014); reliability refers to the
degree to which instrument measures are replicable, stable, and free from error, and validity refers to the degree to
which evidence and theory support the interpretation

Diferent conceptual frameworks exist for validity. Tis
study adopted a construct validity framework, which
encompasses the gathering of evidence in alignment with
several separate but interrelated categories (Messick 1995;
Campbell and Nehm 2013; AERA et al. 2014), specifcally:
(i) evidence based on test content (i.e., content validity),
evidence based on internal structure (i.e., internal structure validity); (iii) evidence based on relationships to other
variables (i.e., convergent and/or discriminant validity);
(iv) evidence based on response processes (i.e., substantive validity); (v) validity generalization (i.e., generalization
validity); and (vi) evidence of consequences. Many studies
are typically needed to capture the full range of evidence
needed to establish construct validity. In this study, we
investigate content validity, internal structure validity, convergent validity, and substantive validity.

To generate evidence based on test content for the
SECM, we used a literature review and expert judgments to specify the content domain, conceptualize the
target construct, and operationalize it in the form of
closed-response items. Content validity addresses the relevance and representativeness of test content in light of
the intended construct (AERA et al. 2014). Evidence for
content validity can involve logical or empirical analyses of the extent to which the test content represents the
intended content domain (AERA et al. 2014).



(a) Content-Oriented Evidence *
(b) Evidence Regarding Cognitive Processes *
(c) Evidence Regarding Internal Structure
(d) Evidence Regarding Relationships With Conceptually Related Constructs
(e) Evidence Regarding Relationships With Criteria
(f) Evidence Based on Consequences of Tests

(a) Content-Oriented Evidence
Standard 1.11
When the rationale for test score interpretation
for a given use rests in part on the appropriateness
of test content, the procedures followed in specifying and generating test content should be described and justified with reference to the intended
population to be tested and the construct the
test is intended to measure or the domain it is
intended to represent. If the definition of the
content sampled incorporates criteria such as
importance, frequency, or criticality, these criteria
should also be clearly explained and justified.
Comment: For example, test developers might
provide a logical structure that maps the items on
the test to the content domain, illustrating the
relevance of each item and the adequacy with
which the set of items represents the content domain. Areas of the content domain that are not
included among the test items could be indicated
as well. The match of test content to the targeted
domain in terms of cognitive complexity and the
accessibility of the test content to all members of
the intended population are also important considerations.


(b) Evidence Regarding Cognitive
Processes
Standard 1.12
If the rationale for score interpretation for a given
use depends on premises about the psychological
processes or cognitive operations of test takers,
then theoretical or empirical evidence in support
of those premises should be provided.When statements about the processes employed by observers
or scorers are part of the argument for validity,
similar information should be provided.
Comment: If the test specification delineates the
processes to be assessed, then evidence is needed
that the test items do, in fact, tap the intended
processes.

(d) Evidence Regarding Relationships
With Conceptually Related Constructs
Standard 1.16
When validity evidence includes empirical analyses
of responses to test items together with data on
other variables, the rationale for selecting the additional variables should be provided. Where appropriate and feasible, evidence concerning the
constructs represented by other variables, as well
as their technical properties, should be presented
or cited. Attention should be drawn to any likely
sources of dependence (or lack of independence)
among variables other than dependencies among
the construct(s) they represent.
Comment: The patterns of association between
and among scores on the test under study and
other variables should be consistent with theoretical
expectations. The additional variables might be
demographic characteristics, indicators of treatment
conditions, or scores on other measures. They
might include intended measures of the same
construct or of different constructs.The reliability
of scores from such other measures and the validity
of intended interpretations of scores from these
measures are an important part of the validity evidence for the test under study. If such variables
include composite scores, the manner in which the composites were constructed should beexplained
(e.g., transformation or standardization of the
variables, and weighting of the variables). In
addition to considering the properties of each
variable in isolation, it is important to guard
against faulty interpretations arising from spurious
sources of dependency among measures, including
correlated errors or shared variance dueto common
methods of measurement or common elements.

Summary
The differentiation between explanations and descriptions plays a major role in science teaching. In biology, in addition to causal explanations, historical and teleological forms of explanation are used to explain facts. Despite consensus about this pluralism of biological explanations, there are hardly any empirical studies about the possibilities this diversity opens up for schoolchildren for their explanations and the learning difficulties associated with it. The aim of this study is therefore to analyze the descriptions and explanations generated by students on biological phenomena with regard to their structure. For this purpose, guided individual interviews were conducted with a total of 10 upper secondary school students. It turns out that pupils between the ages of 17 and 19 can use all forms of description and explanation of biology for various phenomena. However, questions about explanations are often answered with (functional) descriptions instead of explanations. 

introduction
From a scientific didactic point of view, describing and explaining are fundamental skills in connection with scientific ways of thinking and working that should be taught to students in class (e.g. KMK 2005; Harms, Mayer, Harnmann, Bayrhuber & Kattmann, 2004). Accordingly, several competencies in connection with descriptions and explanations are defined in the core curriculum of the state of Lower Saxony for the subject biology (Lower Saxony Ministry of Education, 2007, 2009). It is required that students at the end of secondary level I can distinguish between actual and functional questions (Niedersächsisches Kultusministerium, 2007, p.75) and at the end of upper secondary level II can distinguish between proximate and ultimate questions (Niedersächsisches Kultusministerium, 2009, p.18). In addition, inappropriate final justifications should be avoided by learners of the upper secondary level (Niedersächsisches Kultusministerium, 2009, p. 18). The ability to differentiate between different forms of explanation is one of the process-related competencies in the competence area acquisition of knowledge (core curriculum, secondary level I) or communication (core curriculum, secondary level II). Empirical studies that assess the quality and frequency of students The descriptions and explanations generated and thus check the required ability to differentiate, there is so far very little. Furthermore, the variety of explanations associated with the pluralism of biology offers students a wide variety of content-related development processes. In this respect, the understanding of various forms of explanation and the independent explanation of biological phenomena are also of central importance for the specialist knowledge area. However, due to the so far little differentiated state of research, it can only insufficiently be clarified to what extent pupils of secondary levels I and II are able to generate scientific descriptions and explanations and how they can be supported in this. The research project presented here tries to start by showing and interpreting empirical findings on the quality and frequency of descriptions and explanations by students.


theoretical framework
From an epistemological point of view, descriptions are answers to "what" questions, such as "What is the case?", While explanations give feedback to "\ Varum" questions (Stegmüller, 1983, p. 114). It is characteristic here that, in contrast to explanations, descriptions do not contain any causes. The Hempel-Oppenheim model describes the structure of a scientific explanation, as it is considered to be the desired form of explanation within classical physics and chemistry (inter alia Mohr, 1978). According to this, by a scientific explanation one understands the answer to a "why-question", which contains concrete conditions and regularities (inter alia Popper, 1984, p. 31; Stegmüller, 1983, p. 113-120) explaining phenomenon, the explanandum, on scientific theories or laws and on system-specific conditions - collectively referred to as explanans -
traced back.
However, biology is not only seen as a nomological science, but
It is also understood as a historical natural science that also takes into account one-off events and their consequences (e.g. Harms et al., 2004; Kattmann, 1995; Mayr, 2000, p. 102; Schlosser & Weingarten, 2002, p. 7-11). Different forms of scientific explanations can be derived from this. There are various approaches to systematizing these forms (e.g. Mohr, 1978; Vollmer, 2005; \ Vuketits, 1983, pp. 71-82). In the research project presented here, the systematisation discussed in biology didactics by Kattmann (2006) is to be followed (see Tab. 1). This differs from the other categorizations mainly in that the answer to the "why question" is classified as a form of description and not as an explanation, since no cause is named with one function. The other forms of explanation can can be distinguished from one another as follows: While near-term causes are used in actual causal explanations that emerge from experimental and observational causal analyzes, phenomena in historical causal explanations are traced back to distant causes (see Table 1) - to be the cause of the lawful action of the evolutionary factors (historical nomological) or the unique historical events of nature (historical narrative). In addition to the three causal explanations mentioned above, there are teleological explanations in biology in which the conscious action of organisms is the cause (see Table 1). It should be emphasized here that the question na ch the target is not permissible for all organisms. Rather, it is only for them
To answer organisms whose neural structures enable conscious action and to which intentions can be ascribed (eg human, chimpanzee) In the appendix, the various forms of descriptions and explanations based on the phenomenon of birdsong in spring are shown as examples (Tab. 5).


Question
The central question of the investigation is:
- Which forms of description and explanation do learners use for biological
cal phenomena?


research design and methodology
Following the model of didactic reconstruction (Kattmann, 2007), a technical clarification of the scientific perspectives on descriptions and explanations was carried out (for the philosophy of science, among others, Popper, 1984; for developmental psychology, among others, Sodian, 2002; Wilkening & Huber, 2002; for cognitive linguistics, among others Lakoff & Johnson, 1999).
To capture the learner's perspective, 10 secondary school students (6 girls, 4 boys) from two high schools in the Hanover region were interviewed. The sample was chosen so that the descriptions and explanations of students who have already gained a wide range of experiences in biology lessons and thus with various biological phenomena can be examined.
The individual interviews followed a semi-open structured interview guide, with which the learners were asked to provide descriptions and explanations of the following phenomena: change of coat in the arctic fox, sweating, flight of birds in V-formation, human kissing, social huddling in penguins, orientation of the sperm cell to the egg cell and positive phototropism in plants. The question words that are assigned to the individual forms of description and explanation in Kattmann's system (Tab. 1) were specifically used in the interview questions. Questions aimed at an actual causal explanation, for example with the question word "how?", Were asked, and questions aimed at historically causal explanations were formulated with "why". In addition, the operators "describe" and "explain" were used in the questions.
used. Individual interviews - and the associated small sample - were appropriate as a survey method in order to be able to capture individual descriptions and explanations. This goal presupposes a subject-related data collection with an open and interactive procedure, as offered by qualitative investigation methods. The audio data were transcribed and edited using the Videograph software and subjected to a detailed analysis in the MAXQDA 2007 program. For this purpose, a coding guide based on the systematization according to Kattmann (2006) was developed (Tab. 2). No inter-rater reliability was determined, but the recorded student statements were assigned to the two categories by the author and another researcher and the categorization was validated communicatively (Mayring, 2003, p. 112).


results
With regard to the research question, it was found that 94% of all questions about descriptions (N = 281) were answered with descriptions by the examined sample, but only 41% of all questions about explanations (N = 300) actually received explanations from generated for the students. As the quotations from Steffen and Lara show (Tab. 3), the pupils respond instead with ascertaining or functional descriptions. This means that requests for descriptions are mostly answered in a descriptive manner by the examined group of students. However, requests to make an explanation are also mostly answered with descriptions.

Regardless of the phenomena addressed in the interviews, the most frequently generated form of explanation in all interviews was the teleological explanation. Table 4 shows examples of teleological explanations by Steffen, Ah- mad and Lara for three different phenomena.

Furthermore, it was shown that all the students examined were able to generate all forms of description and explanation in the course of their respective interviews. However, there was no systematic reference to the question posed by the interviewer. For example, causal explanations were developed for questions about historical explanations ("why" questions) as well as questions about functional descriptions ("why" questions). This finding indicates that the ability to generate different forms of explanations was developed in the interview partners examined, but without a regular application oriented to specific questions. This means that the students used different formulas for the same question words.

Forms of descriptions and explanations. At the same time it became clear that the students switch between the different forms of description and explanation within a statement. The following edited excerpt from the transcript shows, for example, how Lara switches between a stating and functional description within a sentence.
Interviewer: Describe the formation in which the birds fly. (shows a picture of the bird flight in V-formation)
Lara (Kl. 12): There are around 25 birds. (. ..) And the strongest animal always flies in front, and the others somehow fly in this V-formation, because if they are attacked in this position they can best defend themselves.
With regard to the generation of historical explanations, it was found that the formulation of the question has an influence on the form of explanation expressed in the answer. For example, Lara (Tab. 3) initially formulates a functional description of a "why" question. When the interviewer adds "Why was it made" to this question (see below), however, the student is able to develop a historical explanation.
Interviewer: What do you think, why did the coat change occur? (also refers to the picture of an arctic fox with summer or winter fur)
Lara (Kl. 12): It is always the case that the stronger one prevails. And probably the dark animal was eaten in winter and the animal with the changed coat survived and multiplied and then transferred the coat change genes.

Discussion and outlook
The findings show that the secondary level II pupils questioned in the study are unable to make any systematic distinction when generating descriptions and explanations. This result coincides with those of Treagust and Harrison (1999, 2000), who found in their research on explanations of physical relationships that students cannot distinguish between descriptions and explanations and these words use synonymously. And Zabel (2009) was also able to show that when asked to explain evolutionary biological phenomena, students mainly formulate descriptions.
Nevertheless, it can be said that all of the subjects in this study were able to establish cause-effect relationships. However, the students mainly name functions of phenomena or motivations and goals of living beings as "causes".
On the basis of the theoretical framework, the pupils do not provide any explanations in the first case, since functions are not considered to be causes and in this respect functional descriptions are formulated by the pupils. If motives and goals are formulated as causal, teleological explanations are available. From an epistemological perspective, however, these can only be applied to organisms that are capable of conscious action. In the present study, however, the teleological explanation was expressed as the most common form of explanation and also for the phenomena in which the conscious action of the living beings involved cannot be assumed (e.g. the positive phototropism of sunflowers). The same results could be achieved in international studies (Abrams & Southerland, 2001; Southerland, Abrams, Cumming & Anzelmo, 2001; Tamir & Zohar, 1991). At the same time, this finding makes it clear that for the sample examined there is a discrepancy between the abilities of the students and the curricular requirements with regard to descriptions and explanations. In Lower Saxony's core curriculum for upper secondary school (Lower Saxony Ministry of Education and Cultural Affairs, 2009) in the area of ​​communication, it is required that pupils avoid goal-related justifications, ie teleological explanations. Furthermore, at the end of secondary level I, pupils should be able to differentiate between functional and actual causal issues (Lower Saxony Ministry of Education, 2007). \ As the results show, both competencies are not trained in the students of the present study. However, it must be taken into account that the present study does not test the students' biological understanding
was carried out. It cannot therefore be clearly clarified whether the frequent generation of descriptions is actually due to the skills deficit or whether it is related to the lack of a professional basis. Subsequent studies will take this aspect into account (Riemeier, 2010).
The finding that students switch between the different forms of descriptions and explanations within an explanatory task was also shown in the studies by Southerland et al. (2001) and Abrams and Southerland (2001). For the authors, this is an indication that the tasks and the various phenomena to be explained have a variable Enabling varied explanations and not just teleological explanations. Based on the recorded results, the same is assumed for the present study.
In summary, it can be stated that the abilities of students with regard to biological description and explanation can be optimized. This leads to the question of learning opportunities that can promote the ability to describe and explain. To develop such interventions, this data material and the data from follow-up studies (Riemeier, 2010) should be evaluated from a different research perspective: While the learner statements were evaluated from the perspective of the theory of science in this article, the future analyzes should be based on the theory of Experience-based understanding (Gropengießer, 2007). In this way, the learner statements are interpreted from the perspective of the pupils, whereby the following questions, among others, have to be answered: What does describing and explaining mean
from the perspective of the students? How do you differentiate between explaining and describing in everyday life? Which everyday situations encourage explaining instead of describing? And last but not least: What are "causes" from a lifeworld perspective and which experiences lead to this understanding? Following the model of didactic reconstruction (Kattmann, 2007), learning offers are to be developed from the comparison of this student perspective with the epistemological perspective on the one hand promote the ability to differentiate between descriptions and explanations or different forms of explanation
as well as the independent generation of various forms of explanation.
