## title slide

+ Good afternoon, I'm really glad to be here today and excited to share the results from my first project in BER.
+ This talk is very different than the talk that I intended on giving when I submitted an abstract to SABER this year
+ So I'll also be sharing with you a little bit about the history of this work and my own personal journey in BER -- especially if there are other students here today that are considering work in BER with relatively little instutional support
+ I started my PhD in ecology and evolution with the intention of becoming a research scientist, and it was halfway through my thesis that I realized that my real passion and interest was in the field of education
+ Somehow I managed to convince my core PhD committee to let me change the direction of my thesis even though none of them had experience in BER, and I added a chemistry education researcher to the team who, at the time, was the closest thing to someone with expertise in BER at my institution
+ I knew that I was interested in how students develop conceptual frameworks in evolutionary biology
+ As evolution is the light that illuminates the discipline of biology, it is essential that our students can both understand evolution and also integrate that knowledge to other aspects of the field

## evolution mountain?

+ a large body of work has demonstrated that a coherent framework of evolutionary biology that allows for deep conceptual understanding of evolutionary concepts does not come easily
+ first, we all need to speak the same words
+ then we need to use those words to understand basic biological processes like DNA replication
+ then we can bring in the idea of ecology along with environmental processes that influence organisms
+ we must start thinking about randomness, probability, and timescale -- what these biological and environmental processes may yield over large timescales
+ now we are about ready to bring in selection and drift, or stochastic and deterministic evolutionary processes,
+ we must learn to distinguish a pattern from the process that generates that pattern
+ and lastly, as mayr famously notes, there are both functional (or proximate) and ultiamte (or evolutionary) causes for any given biological phenomena -- but today i will focus specifically on the concept of adaptation

## proximate and ultimate causality: explanation

+ take, for instance, the question of why wood exists
+ on a functional or proximate-level, wood exists because of secondary growth caused by cell division in the vascular cambium 
+ but there is another explanation for the repeated evolution of wood: inter- and intra-specific competition for light over time
+ that is, there is also an ultimate or evolutionary process responsible for the existence of wood 
+ so, a full understanding of a given trait or adaptation requires that students can reason at both levels of biological explanation

## kampourakis typology

+ however, proposing possible explanations for a given phenomena at _any_ level, whether proximate or ultimate, requires first distinguishing an observable pattern
+ a pattern can be thought of as a description of _what_ has taken place, while a process may be thought of as a causal mechanistic explanation responsible for the existence of whatever has taken place
+ Kampourakis & Niebert propose a typology of biological explanation that addresses the various descriptions and explanations appropriate for various levels of biological heirarchy, reproduced here...
+ the typology distinguishes between two levels of description: what there is (so here, a flying bird), and what functional explanation is appropriate for it (muscles connected to bone). 
+ There are then three possible levels of explanation: proximate causes ( physiological explanations appropriate for individual organisms), ultimate causes (historical explanations related to selective pressures over time), and teleological causes (which describe motives or aims of organisms).
+ teleological explanations are generally incorrect, and use the function or design of a trait, or the personal motivations of the organism, to explain the trait's existence

## the problem

+ this typology provides enormous utility in understanding the various levels of description and explanation possible in biological sciences, but there are two key points this typology does not address:

1. there is a _relationship_ between patterns and processes at various levels, and
2. there are legitimate teleological descriptions in the study of adaptation

## pattern-process relationship (keep numbered points at top)

+ let's return to the question of why wood exists
+ the proximate and ultimate processes responsible for the existence of wood also, of course, produce observable patterns
+ Woody tissue exists both because there are trees, and because trees, like all organisms, must adapt to their environment to survive
+ so, there is an observable pattern at both the proximate and ultimate level -- that trees exist, and that wood has evolved more than once across different groups of plants
+ these patterns or descriptions are what allow scientists to investigate the action of evolutionary processes over time

## legitimate teleological description

+ another feature of ultimate patterns is that while they cannot serve as _explanations_, they serve as a kind of legitimate teleological description
+ examining the current distribution of traits across groups of organisms can provide insight into the kinds of selective pressures responsible for the maintenance of such traits across macroevolutionary timescales
+ and actually much of the current work of evolutionary biology involves determining the observed pattern of a trait across a phylogeny, and then using computational modeling tools to infer what processes produced that observed pattern

## studies on explanation versus description

+ an enormous body of work has examined student construction of causal or mechanistic explanations, but relatively few studies examine the extent to which students provide descriptions in the place of explanations
+ Riemeier finds that only 41% of interviewed students are able to provide causal explanations for biological phenomena when asked to do so, while the remainder provide descriptions
+ However, an interesting feature of some teleological explanations is that, while they are insufficient as explanations, as descriptions, they are often correct. 
+ Take for instance these two statements from a study examining student preference for teleological explanations

Sweating occurs because ...
1. ...inthisway,thebodycaneliminateexcessheat(teleological).
2. ...themusclesthatsurroundthesweatglandscontract(causal).

+ The first, as a causal explanation, is obviously incorrect. 
+ However, as a statement of biological description, it is indeed true that the body eliminates excess heat via persperation. 
+ Moreover, the observed patterns of evaporative heat-loss mechanisms in mammals – and the enormous variation in these mechanisms like panting, sweating, and various kinds of sweat glands – provides valuable fodder for examining the evolutionary mechanisms influencing thermoregulation in mammalian organisms. 
+ which is to say, the observation that the body eliminates excess heat through sweating is not only correct, but an important step in understanding the trait itself and its possible adaptive significance.

+ MENTION THAT THEY BRING THIS UP IN A SUBSEQUENT PAPER!!
The term ontological teleology refers to the assumption that functional structures and mechanisms exist due to their functionality VERSUS
Notably, conceptualizing structures and mechanisms in terms of their ends does not explain biological structures and mechanisms in terms of their causes but identifies5 them in terms of their effects

## discuss the construction of your new framework

+ Niko Tinbergen, leaning on Aristotle, formalized four questions that he argued were all necessary for fully explaining a given trait or adaptation
+ there are developmental and mechanistic explanations relating to individual organisms, and phylogenetic and adaptive explanations relating to groups of organisms or species. 
+ These questions were organized into a grid by Nesse (2013), providing enormous utility as an explanatory framework by addressing both proximate and ultimate causality, along with corresponding proximate and ultimate patterns necessary for making inferences about their generating processes.
+ this grid is valuable in that it organizes the levels of biological description and explanation into a very clear framework

## developing the questions

+ now, when I first planned my BER project I wasn't exactly sure where I wanted to go
+ I wanted to ask layered questions about adaptation, but it was not clear to me what framework I should use to analyze student responses given that I wasn't necessarily interested in students' non-normative ideas perse, but the logic behind their reasoning
+ so first, I developed 15 open-ended questions and did a pilot version during the summer semester
+ the most striking feature of student answers was that, while non-normative ideas were common, in general many answers weren't exactly... wrong
+ for example, I asked students why cave fish -- regardless of the species of fish -- eventually lose their eyesight
+ Many correctly noted that eyes are energetically costly in an environment where they are not used (ultimate pattern), some discussed a mutation occurring in an individual fish without explaining how that mutation may spread across the population -- rarely, some students were able to put these two concepts together to describe an evolutionary process
+ in this way the data really spoke to me: I realized that students were simply addressing various levels of explanation or description across the tinbergen framework

## digress about the intentions of your framework

+ I then developed a set of ten questions about different kinds of adaptation -- emergent features like species ranges, trait loss, trait gain, or even constraints -- in various organisms, and I collected data across the Fall and Spring semester
+ I ended up with just under 600 participants across four biology courses from introductory to advanced
+ I used my new framework to code student responses in an effort to... well, and that's the thing: what exactly was I trying to do? What question was I trying to answer?
+ I had a lot of data, and I discovered, I think, an interesting pattern
+ But I myself had gotten lost in the details of my own work
+ This became especially clear to me after my submitted abstract for this talk I am giving right now was rejected, and reviewer 2 (why is it always reviewer 2??) made some very prescient critiques that I could not ignore.
+ Around the time I found out that I would actually be giving my originally-rejected talk today at SABER, I also discovered that the talk I submitted to the Annual Evolution conference would be presented beside an intimidating group of biology education researchers
+ Honestly, I wanted to crawl under a rock. We don't always talk about how challenging it can be to share work at professional conferences -- certainly for someone like me that struggles with anxiety -- but also for those of us that may be entirely new in a field of study.
+ but, I ended up getting very lucky that Gena Sbeglia from Ross Nehm's lab at Stony Brook graciously chatted with me for a long time after my talk at the Conference, and helped me find some clarity when I was lost in the weeds
+ because what i thought i was doing was developing an assessment that could tell us something about student understanding of evolution

## discuss the proposal of your framework as a tool

+ but indeed what i am actually here to do today is to propose this framework as a tool for systematically assessing student thinking across levels of biological heirarchy
+ it demonstrates whether students more commonly provide descriptions or explanations, and what level of biological explanation they address -- giving us insight into potentially undertaught aspects but also the connections between the levels of biological heirarchy
+ it also has utility is a teaching tool: educators can explicitly teach each component of the grid and guide students as they work through plausible explanations for each portion, helping the students also draw connections between the various components

## validity and reliability evidence

## the pattern you discovered and implications

+ DISCUSS DEMOGRAPHICS OF STUDENTS AND COURSESs
+ show the overall distribution, then the distribution split up by all these other factors.
+ talk about the statistics you used to compare the distributions and how nothing was significant
maybe just say that you're going to show the overall pattern, but you split it up in 1000 ways and no distribution differed significantly from the overall

+ doesn't seem to matter where kids went to high school or how many credits they have or whatever
+ do acknowledge you don't have demographic data/evolution acceptance or understanding, but that this pattern seems really consistent across a very diverse student body
+ tie pattern into the current literature on fractured nature of bio edu and focus on proximate -- also nehm's thing about forming coherent frameworks

## limitations/future work

+ gather other factors like demographics or understanding/acceptance of evolution 
+ semi-structured or structured interviews
+ repeat with instructional intervention


## acknowledgements

+ this work is unfunded, so i appreciate the educators that allowed me to use their courses and the students that participated
+ my advisor joel brown for always encouraging me to follow my heart
+ and drs. sbeglia and nehm from stony brook for their valuable guidance





Students can't create a knowledge framework on the basis of p-prims and memorized facts. They need a concept map, and they need somewhere to begin; they need to be shown how all the parts are interrelated. Classes include: memorizing terms, memorizing examples, memorizing processes -- how often in biology education do we connect all these?

IF YOU CAN'T UNDERSTAND EVOLUTION (at its core, stochastic and deterministic processes that shape life), YOU CAN'T UNDERSTAND BIOLOGY


have provided evidence of students' thinking of knowledge in science as piecemeal information that may not connect to everyday experience, to be accepted on the authority of the teacher or text (Hammer, 1994; Smith, Maclin, Houghton, & Hennessey, 2000).

Still further work concerns how students frame (Goffman, 1974) what is taking place in science class. A variety of accounts have drawn distinctions between students, on the one hand, participating as nascent scientists, trying to make sense of the world as scientists do, and, on the other hand, performing obligations in exchange for credit in the classroom. Lemke called the latter "playing the classroom game"; others have referred to it as "doing the lesson" (Jimenez-Alexiandre, Rodriguez, & Duschl, 2000), "doing school" (Pope, 2001), and being "obedient" (Tobias, 1993).

Students' acceptance that air is matter (or that plants feed by photosynthesis or that sunspots are magnetic phenomena, etc.) could be seen as alignment with the canonical ideas. However, if students accept those ideas on the teacher's authority, rather than because they see them supported over other ideas by evidence and reasoning, then they are at odds with the practices of science.
