# speech

## title slide
+ Hi everyone! My name is Lucy, and I'm a PhD candidate in Evolutionary Biology at University of Illinois at Chicago. 
+ I'm excited to speak to you today about some of my recent work in biology education research
+ Quite obviously, students' understanding of biological sciences is essential to their pursuit of biology-related degrees and careers
+ But more than that, a robust understanding of biological concepts can foster empathetic and engaged members of our global community that value the natural world and our connection to it

## biology has a problem

+ So, human fascination with the diversity of living creatures -- including pondering questions like 'where do all these creatures come from?' and 'what does it even mean to be alive?' -- transcends cultures and disciplines and eras and is a fundamental part of the human experience
+ All that being said, this fascination does not always transcend students' boredom in the classroom
+ first, biology can feel like memorization when its presented, as it often is, as facts and examples devoid of connection, and each course is siloed as if it's an entirely separate discipline
+ this presentation of piecemeal facts unrelated to everday experience is not especially motivating, when learning becomes more challenging

## raw data demo

## ADD BACK REAL DEMO!!

+ Unfortunately I don't have time to illustrate this with a real demonstration so you'll have to take my word for it
+ but studies have shown that if I were to show you these letters and give you 20 seconds to memorize them in the order they appear, it's very unlikely that you could
+ however, if i show you the same letters organized like this --> now memorizing them in twenty seconds would be easy
+ why is it so much easier this way?
+ Well, because remember concepts is far easier than remembering raw data!!
+ this way you aren't remembering the letters as all, you were remembering the concept behind those letters as hooks to latch the letters in your mind
+ so when we present students with facts and examples without the meat of conceptual understanding behind it, or "good hooks", we are essentially asking them to memorize raw data

## swan slide

+ Here evolutionary theory becomes essential, because evoltionary theory IS the concept behind the raw data
+ It's the _reason_ why prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells are different, and the _reason_ there are the enormous diversity of forms and features we observe today on earth


# ADD BACK EVOLUTION MOUNTAIN!!! 

## bison slide

+ But thinking about evolutionary theory and big picture biology involves some special cognitive abilities
+ Biology is a historical science: in a very real sense, organisms are all a product of historical processes that can be traced back billions of years
+ So here, we must first be able to distinguish an observed pattern from whatever historical processes that may be responsible for it
+ But also, we must be able to distinguish between proximate (or functional) and ultimate (or evolutionary) causes for observed patterns and their generating processes

## study design

+ Problematically, decades of literature demonstrates that students hold tenacious misconceptions about the process of natural selection
+ So to more-closely examine the logic underlying students' reasoning, I administered an assignment with five open-ended questions across four biology courses
+ Students had two weeks to answer; they were encouraged to use and cite resources to support their claims
+ They did this once at the beginning of the semester and once at the end

## tinbergen framework

+ I coded student responses based on a framework adapted from Tinbergen's four questions
+ This was organized into a grid by Nesse, which I then modified slightly --> each portion of the grid contains an appropriate cause for a phenomenon
+ I'm going to talk through a sample assignment question and _correct_ responses for each cause --> read question
+ We'll start here with the proximate or individual level row: the material cause, all organisms are constructed differently, have different DNA; then the efficient cause, the individual-level processes that generate this observed variation like mutation, sexual reproduction or recombination 
+ now the ultimate or species level row: the cause of form, organisms take advantage of the environment in different ways causing them to look different; and finally the evolutionary cause, the ultimate process responsible for that pattern biological trade-offs and environmental heterogeneity over large timescales
+ And this evolutioinary cause is the level of explanation we hope to see from students following instruction

## turtle

+ so, we administered this assignment across four courses over two semesters, with over 600 student participatns
+ what happened?

## results

## MAKE FIGURE THAT INCLUDES MORE DEMO INFORMATION!!!

+ student responses largely fell into one of these categories
+ sometimes they invoked one cause, sometimes two
+ but the nature of the ultimate process explanation means that this was never paired with other causes

+ Now, on the y-axis we have causes and on the x-axis the frequency they were invoked...
+ here is the intitial distribution before instruction, and you can see that students largely invoke proximate processes, ultiamte patterns, or they pair these causes together
+ And after instruction we're really hoping they start nailing this evolutionary cause
+ But you can see, the distribution remains mostly unchanged: while individuals invoke varying causes, we see the same general pattern both before and after instruction, regardless of students' major, number of previous credits in biology, the course they were taking...

+ So great, formal instruction is not helping -- but you may be wondering _how_ students are actually constructing these explanations

## misconceptions

## ADD BACK ACTUAL MISCONCEPTION SLIDE!!! WITH EXAMPLES!!!

+ there's a bit of a debate in the education literature about the nature of misconceptions
+ some suggest that misconceptions are deeply-held and stable alternative frameworks that are extremely resistent to formal training
+ others suggest that actually misonceptions are dynamic and highly context-sensitive
+ i would say that in this study, the shifting logic both within and between assignments provides more evidence for the latter -- dynamic and context-sensitive-- but that's a whole nother talk...
+ in my own experience, apparent misconceptions are often the result of students "playing the classroom game", or in other words, the act of hoping to repeat the correct answer teacher said without understanding the underlying concepts

## engaging with ideas

## MAKE THIS MORE EDUCATION RESEARCH PEOPLE FOCUSED, NOT BIOLGIST FOCUSED!!!

+ and it's a bit tricky to make sure that students are really getting those underlying concepts
+ but a few things can help: one of the most important is fostering discussion and then engaging with students ideas -- not just to evaluate how close their words are to the appropriate words, but to really try and understand the _reasoning_ behind what they're saying
+ it can help to start very small, with core concepts or "familiar schemas", which are like blueprints for things we experience in everyday life

+ so take the simple and familiar schema of a coin flip --> for our purpose here, try to go back to when this was just a coin and not a locus with two alleles
+ so this function simulates n number of coin flips and returns the frequency of heads and tails
+ i'm going to fly through some quick-and-dirty examples here, starting with the process of genetic drift
+ students have a hard time understanding what drift is and why its strength decreases as population size increases
+ genetic drift, at its core, is simply a statistical consequence of finite sample sizes
+ I ask students: if i flip a coin ten times, how many heads do i expect? 5. easy.
+ Okay, if i flip in ten times, how many heads will i actually observe? here i get some crickets.
+ i could get 5, or 7, or 3, and we wouldn't necessarily think my function was broken
+ our sample size is just small, so we expect greater variance from our expectation in a single trial
+ so i end up with 2 heads and 8 tails
+ Now what if i increase my sample size?
+ the more i increase my sample size, the closer i get to my expectation --> this is a window into the _reason_ why the strength of drift decreases as the population size increases

+ now natural selection is a non-random process, so i've added a line here that allows me to alter the probability of observing heads
+ so i flip my coin ten times again, but with a new probability of 52%
+ and, i still get 50/50 because my sample size is small
+ but, as i increase my sample size, we can see that i'm now consistenly observing a greater frequency of heads each time

## expanding those ideas

+ so for us biologists, this is just "one generation", so to speak, of coin flips, which are not inherited traits
+ but by starting with small core concepts we can help students build a robust framework by consistently checking on on how they understand what's happening as we add more complexty
+ next, what processes that leave disproportionate frequencies of one thing over the other may yield over hundreds or thousands of generations
+ of course, unlike coin flips, these "things" are inherited in specific ways, without which these processes could not work
+ then we can start to think about the interplay between stochastic processes like drift along side deterministic ones like selection
+ and then, we can introduce the idea of mutation itself as a process

## conclusion slide

## REWORK THIS ONCE EVERYTHING IS IN PLACE!!

+ the idea of educators or textbooks telling students what the "answer" is without discussing what _reasoning_ is necessary to believe one idea over the other is at odds with how science is actually done in real life
+ so better biology education begins with educators moving away from focusing on "right answers", and bringing the focus to the _reasoning_ and information required to distinguish right answers from wrong ones
+ it helps to deal in concepts and not in raw data
+ we can use simple existing schemas to slowly build more complex ideas
+ but most importantly, we must always stay focused on the substance of students' reasoning -- really working to understand why they think what they think -- and get away from the "classroom game" by making the classroom a place that reflects the real work of scientists in distinguishing right and wrong or good and bad ideas
+ thanks so much for your time, please feel free to visit my GitHub page for more materials on this talk and associated references
and i'm happy to take any questions!

# notes

Students can't create a knowledge framework on the basis of p-prims and memorized facts. They need a concept map, and they need somewhere to begin; they need to be shown how all the parts are interrelated. Classes include: memorizing terms, memorizing examples, memorizing processes -- how often in biology education do we connect all these?

IF YOU CAN'T UNDERSTAND EVOLUTION (at its core, stochastic and deterministic processes that shape life), YOU CAN'T UNDERSTAND BIOLOGY


have provided evidence of students' thinking of knowledge in science as piecemeal information that may not connect to everyday experience, to be accepted on the authority of the teacher or text (Hammer, 1994; Smith, Maclin, Houghton, & Hennessey, 2000).

Still further work concerns how students frame (Goffman, 1974) what is taking place in science class. A variety of accounts have drawn distinctions between students, on the one hand, participating as nascent scientists, trying to make sense of the world as scientists do, and, on the other hand, performing obligations in exchange for credit in the classroom. Lemke called the latter "playing the classroom game"; others have referred to it as "doing the lesson" (Jimenez-Alexiandre, Rodriguez, & Duschl, 2000), "doing school" (Pope, 2001), and being "obedient" (Tobias, 1993).

Students' acceptance that air is matter (or that plants feed by photosynthesis or that sunspots are magnetic phenomena, etc.) could be seen as alignment with the canonical ideas. However, if students accept those ideas on the teacher's authority, rather than because they see them supported over other ideas by evidence and reasoning, then they are at odds with the practices of science.
